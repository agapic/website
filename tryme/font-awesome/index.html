                    <p class="large text-muted tab">Hey everyone! My name's Andrew and I'm a first year Software Engineering student attending the University of Waterloo (currently 1B). I love technology of any sort; anything to do with computers or video games fancies my interest, as they have been an integral part of my life ever since the age of three. Expanding on this, I have an inherent passion for optimizing games -- whether with a pencil or coding away on the computer. I remember being three years old playing Chip's Challenge (a puzzle game that was included in Microsoft's Windows 95 Entertainment pack) on the family's Windows 95 computer. From this game, I began designing my own levels and eventually began optimizing the game (you can  <a href="http://www.jamesa7171.net/cclp3ms.htm">find my highscores here</a>)</p>
                 <br>
                     <p class="large text-muted tab">During high school, I had great difficulty in deciding what I wanted to do in life. I'm actually quite amazed that most people in SE knew exactly what they wanted to do since high school, some even since middle school. After high school, I decided to go into business because at that specific moment in time, I found the courses related to engineering to be quite boring (Calculus, Physics, etc), and many people whom I sought advice from suggested that Business is an excellent program because it is such a diverse field. I decided to go to McMaster because it was unsettling for me to live far away from home. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="large text-muted tab">Unfortunately, I was never really interested in any of the courses I took and I found myself playing video games and coding, while studying a few days before the exam and typically doing quite well. Eventually, I began to get more involved and joined the investment club and was chosen to participate in a <a href="http://aciic.com/">provincial wide stock pitch competition</a>, where our team earned second place pitching Scholastic. While I definitely had fun, some part of me felt regrets for not enrolling into Engineering or Computer Science. I knew I loved everything about computers but I just felt like it was too late to switch, so I decided to pursue Finance as it was the only remotely interesting subject to me.</p><br>
                        
                        <p class="large text-muted tab">In third year I enrolled in the co-op program at McMaster and went on a 12 month internship. The experience and knowledge gained was irreplacable, especially with respect to soft skills as learning how to deal with people is an invaluable skill. During my internship, I found myself coding a lot while being less interested in the financial side of the business, and this reinforced the idea that I should try to transfer into engineering. I conducted a lot of research on Software Engineering/Computer Science programs at different universities, and decided I would try to get into Waterloo because of its amazing reputation, ambitious students, and awesome co-op opportunities. Regarding admissions, I can't stress enough how important <a href="http://profbillanderson.wordpress.com/">Professor Bill Anderson's blog</a> was; I read every post top to bottom.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        While technology and computers are extremely important to me, I also love:

I'll likely be posting progress pics within the month.<hr></li>
                        
<li>Take Udacity courses for Javascript, Python, and Ruby.<hr></li>
