<font face="courier"><br><br>Oh yeah, it would probably help you if you make the string look <em>beautif</em>ul<br>
You may think that the potential solutions may <em>var</em>y, but there is one answer for this string. <br>To relieve ambiguity, just look at the joke, funny or not. <br>That guy looks sad. We don't want anything to do with his table.<br><em>Also, file names mean nothing to us. We care about what's inside.</em><br>

Alright, alright. It seems to be the consensus to add another hint. Let's do it. From the big blob of seemingly useless text, there are FIVE results you will find. You can find three (call them the magic three) of them easily (this is <em>shown</em> in the hint(s) above). From the magic three, you can find two more results, and you need to overwrite these results somewhere. (this is where one of the hints becomes incredibly important, you should also understand how json works at a basic level)
