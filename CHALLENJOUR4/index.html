<font face="courier">Hi hackers.<br> Welcome to Challenge <b>4</b> <br> As kind, caring, and generous as we are, we made sure each piece from this challenge was <em>equal</em> in difficulty, for challenge <em>four</em>. <br>The puppet up there only sees things in black and white, there is no in between. If you meet his requirements, he will give you a surprise. <br><br>IF you manage to succeed, the password is child/parent. What you will find is of utmost importance.<br>Note, username is "a" for every authentication window.<br><a href="/CHALLENJOUR4/wukongorfeed">DO YOU DARE?</a></font>
